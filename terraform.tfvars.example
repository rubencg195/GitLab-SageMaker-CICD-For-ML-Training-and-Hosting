# This file is for reference only
# Since we're not using variables, all configuration is in locals.tf
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and modify the values in locals.tf if needed

# Example of how you could structure this if using variables:
# project_name = "gitlab-server"
# environment = "production"
# aws_region = "us-west-2"
# gitlab_instance_type = "t3.large"
# gitlab_volume_size = 100

# Note: This project uses locals.tf for configuration instead of variables
# All configuration values are defined in locals.tf and can be modified there
