# SageMaker Training Job CI/CD with GitLab on AWS

This project deploys a complete **SageMaker ML Training Pipeline** with **GitLab CI/CD** on AWS using OpenTofu/Terraform. The solution provides automated machine learning training workflows with comprehensive CI/CD pipeline management, artifact storage, and monitoring capabilities.

## üéØ Project Overview

This solution provides:
- **Complete GitLab CE Server Infrastructure** deployed on AWS
- **SageMaker Training Job CI/CD Pipeline** with automated workflows
- **Modular Script Architecture** for different training job types
- **S3 Artifact Management** with automated packaging and storage
- **Production-ready Architecture** with monitoring, security, and cost optimization
- **Three-Script Workflow**: Destroy ‚Üí Setup ‚Üí Launch architecture

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Three-Script Modular Architecture

The project uses a modular three-script architecture designed for flexibility and reusability:

1. **Infrastructure Setup** (`configure-gitlab-cicd`) - Sets up GitLab infrastructure, runners, and CI/CD variables
2. **Training Job Launcher** (`launch-train-job.sh`) - Deploys training repository and triggers pipelines
3. **Complete Cleanup** (`remove-gitlab-cicd.sh`) - Destroys all GitLab configurations and returns to fresh state

This architecture allows for:
- **Multiple Training Job Types**: Easy addition of different launcher scripts for various ML frameworks
- **Clean Separation**: Infrastructure vs. deployment concerns
- **Reproducible Workflows**: Consistent destroy ‚Üí setup ‚Üí launch cycles

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. GitLab Not Accessible
**Symptoms**: Cannot access GitLab web interface
**Solutions**:
- Wait 5-10 minutes for GitLab to fully initialize
- Run health check: `./server-scripts/check-gitlab-health.sh --verbose`
- Check security group allows HTTP/HTTPS traffic

#### 1.1 GitLab 422 Error (The change you requested was rejected)
**Symptoms**: Login page shows "422: The change you requested was rejected" error
**Solutions**:
- This indicates CSRF token or form validation issues
- Run health check: `./server-scripts/check-gitlab-health.sh --verbose` (detects this error)
- Try accessing GitLab web interface manually to complete setup
- GitLab may still be initializing - wait a few more minutes

#### 2. Training Pipeline Failures
**Symptoms**: CI/CD pipeline fails during training stage
**Solutions**:
- Check SageMaker IAM role permissions
- Verify S3 bucket access and policies
- Review training script logs in GitLab

#### 3. S3 Access Issues
**Symptoms**: Cannot upload artifacts to S3
**Solutions**:
- Verify IAM role has S3 permissions
- Check bucket names in CI/CD variables
- Test S3 access: `aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name`

#### 4. Runner Registration Issues
**Symptoms**: GitLab runner not appearing or failing jobs
**Solutions**:
- Check runner status: `ssh ubuntu@[IP] "sudo gitlab-runner status"`
- Re-run configure script: `./server-scripts/configure-gitlab-cicd`
- Verify runner token and registration

#### 5. GitLab Runner Dependencies Missing (FIXED)
**Symptoms**: Pipeline fails with `pip: command not found` or similar dependency errors
**Solutions**:
- Install Python and pip on GitLab runner: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip`
- Update runner configuration to include dependency installation
- Use Docker executor instead of shell executor for better isolation
- Check runner environment setup in `/etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml`

#### 6. GitLab Runner Registration Issues (Internet Connectivity)
**Symptoms**: Runner registration fails with `i/o timeout` or package installation errors during `configure-gitlab-cicd`
**Solutions**:
- **Verify internet egress**: Ensure GitLab server security group allows outbound internet access (0.0.0.0/0)
- **Check package repositories**: Test connectivity to Ubuntu repositories: `curl -s http://us-east-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu`
- **Test external connectivity**: Verify GitLab server can reach external sites: `curl -s https://packages.gitlab.com`
- **Security group configuration**: Ensure `gitlab_sg` has egress rule: `0.0.0.0/0` for all protocols
- **Apply security group changes**: Run `tofu apply -auto-approve` to update security group rules

#### 7. Pipeline Not Triggering
**Symptoms**: No pipelines appear after pushing code
**Solutions**:
- Verify `.gitlab-ci.yml` file exists in repository root
- Check GitLab project CI/CD settings are enabled
- Ensure runners are configured with `run_untagged = true`
- Verify GitLab runner is running and connected
