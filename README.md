# SageMaker Training Job CI/CD with GitLab on AWS

This project deploys a complete **SageMaker ML Training Pipeline** with **GitLab CI/CD** on AWS using OpenTofu/Terraform. The solution provides automated machine learning training workflows with comprehensive CI/CD pipeline management, artifact storage, and monitoring capabilities.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This solution provides:
- **Complete GitLab CE Server Infrastructure** deployed on AWS
- **SageMaker Training Job CI/CD Pipeline** with automated workflows
- **Modular Script Architecture** for different training job types
- **S3 Artifact Management** with automated packaging and storage
- **Production-ready Architecture** with monitoring, security, and cost optimization
- **Three-Script Workflow**: Destroy → Setup → Launch architecture

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Three-Script Modular Architecture

The project uses a modular three-script architecture designed for flexibility and reusability:

1. **Infrastructure Setup** (`configure-gitlab-cicd`) - Sets up GitLab infrastructure, runners, and CI/CD variables
2. **Training Job Launcher** (`launch-train-job.sh`) - Deploys training repository and triggers pipelines
3. **Complete Cleanup** (`remove-gitlab-cicd.sh`) - Destroys all GitLab configurations and returns to fresh state

This architecture allows for:
- **Multiple Training Job Types**: Easy addition of different launcher scripts for various ML frameworks
- **Clean Separation**: Infrastructure vs. deployment concerns
- **Reproducible Workflows**: Consistent destroy → setup → launch cycles

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

1. **AWS CLI configured** with appropriate credentials
2. **OpenTofu installed** (latest version recommended)
3. **SSH key pair** available at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
4. **AWS permissions** to create VPC, EC2, EBS, Route53, IAM resources

### Step 1: Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
# Clone and navigate to project directory
cd GitLab-SageMaker-CICD-For-ML-Training-and-Hosting

# Initialize OpenTofu
tofu init

# Deploy the infrastructure (5-8 minutes)
tofu apply -auto-approve
```

### Step 2: Complete Workflow - Destroy → Setup → Launch

#### 2.1 Clean Setup (Destroy)
```bash
# Reset GitLab to fresh state (optional for new deployments)
echo "yes" | ./server-scripts/remove-gitlab-cicd.sh
```

#### 2.2 Configure CI/CD Infrastructure
```bash
# Set up GitLab project, runners, and CI/CD variables
./server-scripts/configure-gitlab-cicd
```

#### 2.3 Launch Training Job
```bash
# Deploy training repository and trigger pipeline
# Use the command provided by the configure script output
./server-scripts/launch-train-job.sh [GITLAB_IP] [GITLAB_URL] [TOKEN] [PROJECT_ID] [PROJECT_NAME]
```

**Example Complete Workflow:**
```bash
# Complete cycle
echo "yes" | ./server-scripts/remove-gitlab-cicd.sh  # Clean slate
./server-scripts/configure-gitlab-cicd                # Setup infrastructure  
./server-scripts/launch-train-job.sh 34.228.48.181 http://34.228.48.181 [TOKEN] 6 training-job-cicd-demo
